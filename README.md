## Summary

### Make img completely round

```css
border-radius: 50%;
```

### Use group CSS selector
```css
h1, h2, h4 {
	text-shadow: 0px 0px 1px black;
}```

### Turn the header into a flexbox

> heading elements are block by default.

```css
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;  /* This means column direction, default is row */
    justify-content: center; /* start, center, end, space-around, 
    space-evenly, space-between */
    align-items: center; /* default is stretch, start, center, end */
```

### Replace img with a div
```css
.gift-img {
  background-image: url("images/gift-cover.jpg"); 
  background-size: cover;
  margin: 0px auto;
}
```
> text-align only centers in-line elements.

### Make elements change on hover
```css
.gift-img:hover {
  background-image: url("images/happy.gif");
}```

### Reuse classes, be specific with IDs

```css
.gift-img {
  /* ... */
}

#gift-img-happy:hover {
  background-image: url("images/happy.gif"); 
}

#gift-img-hot:hover {
  background-image: url("images/hot.gif"); 
}
